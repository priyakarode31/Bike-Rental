# Bike-Rental
Bike sharing is an innovative approach to urban mobility, combining the convenience and flexibility of a bicycle with the accessibility of public transportation. A bike sharing system is a service in which users can rent/use bicycles available for shared use on a short term basis for a price. Such system usually aim to reduce congestion, noise and air pollution by providing affordable access to bikes for short distance trips as opposed to motorised vehicles. The number of users on any given day can vary greatly for such systems depending upon various factors. Our aim is to use and optimise Machine Learning Models that effectively predict the number of ride-sharing bikes that will be used in any given day, using available information about that particular day.
